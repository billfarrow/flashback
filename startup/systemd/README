I'm no systemd expert.  But this is how I set up
flashback to start automatically on my PogoPlug4
running Arch Linux.

I included two copies of the "flashback.service"
file in:
/etc/systemd/system/flashback.service
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/flashback.service

The service file runs a bash script that lives in root's home
directory.  It takes care of some startup details, like waiting
for the time to be set over the network before allowing the
flashback script to run.  It also kicks off a monitor script
that blinks the LED, and a small script that keeps my external
USB drive from going to sleep (a hack).

I hope this is enough of a start to get flashback to run on
your systemd-based system.  If you know what you're doing,
please consider revising these instructions to be more clear
and more reliable.
