Description: Greenback is an rsync-based backup daemon.
 Greenback makes rotating backups of remote filesystems using the "rsync"
 utility.  It runs as a daemon, waking up every so often to see which sources
 need backing up.  If the last backup is at least "a day" old (configurable
 globally or per source), it will connect and start backing up.  Rsync is very
 efficient, because it only copies files that have changed.  Furthermore,
 Greenback uses rsync's "link-dest" option to use hard links so it only has
 a single copy of an unchanged file across several backups.  The resulting
 backup is identical to the source, having the same file structure, permissions,
 ownerships and time stamps as the source.  This daemon started as a wrapper
 around "rsback" (http://www.pollux.franken.de/en/backup/rsback/), but later
 I found that I was not really using any of rsback's features, and so I modified
 it to just call rsync directly.
